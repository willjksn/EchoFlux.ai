## Caption Generation Updates

### Media Analysis Requirements

**For Images:**
- Analyze intimate/explicit details shown: poses, outfits, setting, mood, composition
- Describe specific explicit/intimate aspects of what's visually shown
- Focus on what explicit content is displayed in the image

**For Videos:**
- Analyze intimate/explicit scenes shown throughout the video
- Describe explicit/intimate details of what's happening
- Focus on specific explicit content shown throughout the video

### Caption Style - Mixed Approach

**Caption Variety Required:**

**TYPE 1 - Explicit Descriptive Captions (At least 1 required):**
- ✅ Analyze and describe actual explicit content shown
- ✅ Use bold, explicit language about what's visually shown
- ✅ Describe specific poses, outfits, settings, actions, moods
- ✅ Make it enticing through explicit, detailed description
- ✅ Focus on describing what viewers are seeing in detail

**TYPE 2 - Sales/Monetization Captions (At least 1 required):**
- ✅ Focus on driving subscriptions, purchases, and monetization
- ✅ Sales-oriented language that promotes exclusivity and subscriber benefits
- ✅ Include CTAs that drive subscriptions, purchases, or exclusive content access
- ✅ Create urgency and desire for paid content or subscriptions
- ✅ Promote exclusive content, subscriber benefits, and monetization opportunities

**Additional Captions:**
- ✅ Mix of explicit descriptions and sales-focused approaches
- ✅ Different angles, moods, approaches to the same content

**Should NOT:**
- ❌ Generic "subscribe for more" messages (without context)
- ❌ Platform name mentions in descriptive captions (only optional in sales captions)
- ❌ All captions being the same type
- ❌ Repetitive subscription prompts
- ❌ Forced or spammy platform mentions

### Example Captions

*Explicit Descriptive Caption:*
```

```

*Sales/Monetization Caption (with platform mention):*
```
"Something exclusive just for my subscribers... 🔥 This intimate photoset and so much more waiting behind the scenes. Join my OnlyFans for full access."
```

*Sales/Monetization Caption (without platform mention):*
```
"Something exclusive just for my subscribers... 🔥 This intimate photoset and so much more waiting behind the scenes. Join for full access."
```

**Video shows behind-the-scenes:**

```
"Behind the camera: Setting up this intimate scene took hours. The mood, the lighting, every angle planned to perfection. This is the real work."
```

*Sales/Monetization Caption (with platform mention):*
```
"See exactly how I create this content - exclusive behind-the-scenes available now on my Fanvue. Subscribers get full access plus custom requests."
```

"Want more intimate moments like this? Join my OnlyFans for exclusive content, custom requests, and personalized experiences. Limited spots available."
```

- ✅ **Bold, adult-oriented hashtags** that describe what's shown
- ✅ **Specific to content**: poses, outfits, mood, setting, explicit/intimate aspects

**Example Explicit Hashtags:**

- `#intimatephoto #sensualphotography #boudoirphotography #adult #mature`
- `#sexycontent #intimatecontent #lingerie #intimates #sexylingerie` (when applicable)

**Should NOT:**
- ❌ Generic hashtags like `#follow #subscribe #like`
- ❌ Platform name hashtags
- ❌ Repeated same hashtags across all captions

**Variety:** Each caption should have different hashtags that relate to specific aspects of what's shown in that particular media.
