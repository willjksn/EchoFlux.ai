#[App Breakdown]

## What the App Is

EchoFlux.ai is an all-in-one creator workflow app for planning content, writing captions, managing media, building a bio link page, and scheduling posts. It also includes a Premium Content Studio for creators who sell on platforms like OnlyFans, Fansly, or Fanvue.

## Who It’s For

- Creators who want a clear workflow to go from ideas → captions → scheduling.
- Premium creators who need weekly planning, monetized content ideas, and fan messaging tools.
- Teams or agencies are supported only where those features are visible in the UI (not covered here).

## How a Creator Uses It (End‑to‑End Flow)

1. **Find Trends**  
   Start with `Find Trends` to discover what’s popular in your niche and save ideas for later.

2. **Plan My Week**  
   Generate a weekly plan based on your goals. Add media, generate captions, pick free/paid content type, and set audience (Free Fan or Paid Fan).  
   Use `Add to calendar` to schedule content.

3. **Write Captions**  
   Create captions for specific posts. Upload media, generate captions, edit them, add hashtags, and preview how they’ll look on mobile.

4. **My Schedule**  
   Review everything in the calendar. Edit dates, captions, or delete posts before they go live.

5. **My Vault**  
   Keep all your photos and videos organized in folders for fast reuse.

6. **Bio Link Page**  
   Build your link-in-bio page, add teaser images, links, and an email signup form. Publish when ready.

7. **Premium Content Studio (if applicable)**  
   Use the premium tabs for monetized content workflows:  
   `Find Trends → Plan My Week → Write Captions → Weekly Money Calendar / My Schedule`  
   This is where you handle PPV ideas, subscriber messaging, and monetization planning.
