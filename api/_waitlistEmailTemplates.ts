We’re currently onboarding a small group of early testers so we can stay close to feedback and refine workflows before full release.

If selected, you’ll receive:
• early platform access
• direct feature feedback opportunities
• roadmap visibility
• extended testing allowances

We’ll reach out soon with next steps.

EchoFlux is currently operating in offline / planning-first mode, with a focus on:
• content strategy generation
• caption workflows
• calendar planning
• media organization

During testing, we’re especially looking for feedback around:
✔ ease of navigation
✔ clarity of workflows
✔ feature usefulness
✔ areas where structure could improve

We’ll send your onboarding link shortly — along with a short setup guide.

2️⃣ Move items onto your calendar
3️⃣ Use Compose to generate captions
4️⃣ Attach media from your library
5️⃣ Copy + post manually to your platforms
