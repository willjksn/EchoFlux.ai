# Premium Content Studio (Elite) — Step-by-Step

Purpose-built workspace for monetized creators on platforms like OnlyFans/Fansly/Fanvue, combining strategy, captions, calendar, media, engagement tools, and exports. Included with the Elite plan.

## 0) Access and setup
- Ensure you’re on the Elite plan (includes Premium Content Studio, advanced strategy, enhanced trend research, 1,500 captions, unlimited links, and 10 GB storage).
- Confirm your creator profile is complete (niche, audience, offers, tone/voice, revenue goals). This powers all Studio generations.

## 1) Open Content Brain (strategy-to-content hub)
- Start with a Premium Content Studio generation: platform-optimized captions, post ideas, weekly plans, and strategic calendars aimed at revenue.
- Inputs: goal, tone, platforms, and desired pacing; outputs: roadmap + content packs ready to schedule.
- Use the media picker to pull assets from the Media Library while you shape posts.

## 2) Build the weekly plan
- Create a 7–14 day plan of posts with attached captions/scripts and media.
- Push items directly onto the Visual Content Calendar so you can spot gaps.
- Keep Draft → Ready-to-Post progress visible via the Workflow Board.

## 3) Engagement tools (audience revenue focus)
- Use Roleplay & Chatting Sessions for guided fan conversations with real-time AI suggestions tailored to your voice.
- Track VIPs, preferences, and spending patterns with Fan Management to prioritize high-intent followers.
- Keep goal/tone context updated so replies stay on-brand and conversion oriented.

## 4) Export & Analytics
- Generate Export Hub packages for ready-to-upload content sets.
- Use Funnel Teaser Packs to create cross-platform promo content that drives traffic to premium offers.
- Review Analytics-style insights in the Studio to see what’s working and adjust upcoming content.

## 5) Calendar & workflow execution
- In the Visual Content Calendar, click any slot to edit timing, swap media, or copy captions/scripts.
- Maintain a rolling 14-day buffer; drag-and-drop adjustments keep pacing consistent.
- Manual posting keeps accounts safe; copy content from the calendar/workflow to publish on target platforms.

## 6) Link-in-Bio for conversion
- Build or refine your Link-in-Bio with unlimited links on Elite; capture subscribers and direct fans to premium offers.
- Update offers weekly to align with campaigns generated in the Studio.

## 7) Suggested weekly cadence
- Monday: Generate/refresh the Content Brain plan; load the Workflow Board with this week’s posts.
- Midweek: Run Roleplay/Chatting Sessions for VIPs; adjust based on engagement signals.
- Friday: Export promo packs, update Link-in-Bio offers, and re-seed next week’s calendar with fresh Studio generations.
