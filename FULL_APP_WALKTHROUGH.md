## 4) Create content (AI Content Generation)

## 5) Organize assets (Media Library)
- Upload images/videos into the Media Library to keep content organized.
- Reuse assets across campaigns; select from the library when generating or finalizing posts.

## 6) Plan and move work forward (Workflow Board)
- Use the kanban-style Workflow Board to move items from Draft → Ready-to-Post.
- Review and edit AI-generated packs, attach media from the library, and finalize copy before scheduling.

## 7) Visualize and adjust schedule (Visual Content Calendar)
- Open the calendar to see planned posts across days/weeks.
- Click a slot to adjust timing, edit copy, or swap attached media.
- Keep a 14-day+ horizon of content visible to maintain cadence.

## 8) Build conversion surface (Smart Link-in-Bio)

- Publish the link to convert engagement into owned audiences.

## 9) Voice, guidance, and assistant support
- Use the AI Voice Assistant and guided prompts when you’re stuck.

## 10) Export, copy, and post manually
- Export or copy finalized captions/scripts from calendar or workflow.
- Post manually to your platforms (account-safe, per landing-page guidance).

## 11) Weekly operating rhythm (recommended)

- Tuesday–Thursday: Generate/approve captions and attach media; keep the calendar filled 7–14 days out.
- Friday: Update Link-in-Bio offers; review analytics-style insights to adjust next week’s focus.
- Daily: Use the assistant for tweaks, respond to engagement, and keep Draft → Ready-to-Post flowing.
