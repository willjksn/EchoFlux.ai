    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: February 14, 2026</p>

    <p>EchoFlux ("we", "our", "us") provides creator planning and productivity tools at echoflux.ai.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, and payment-related metadata when you register
      and use EchoFlux. We also collect media files (images and videos) that you upload to the platform, including items in
      My Vault, profile images, and bio link images.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use collected information to operate, maintain, and provide features of the service. EchoFlux is currently focused on
      planning and content creation workflows. Some social integrations or automation features may be unavailable, limited, or in testing
      depending on product version and plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use account and usage data to support authentication, account security, billing, troubleshooting, and product improvements.
      We may send service-related notices and transactional emails.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Sent to AI Models and User Content</h2>
    <h3>a. Data Sent to AI Models</h3>
    <p>
      To deliver core functionality, prompts you enter and (when you choose) uploaded media may be sent to third-party AI providers
      (for example, Google Gemini) to generate captions, hashtags, planning suggestions, and strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not use this data to train our own foundation models. Third-party providers process data under their own policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weekly trends data may be collected on a recurring schedule for strategy features. This shared trends data is general and
      does not include personal user data.
    </p>

    <h3>b. User-Uploaded Media</h3>
    <p>
      Uploaded media is stored using managed cloud storage (including Firebase Storage) and is used only to provide app features
      such as caption generation, planning workflows, and content organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can delete uploaded media from within the app. Backup systems may retain data for a limited period before permanent deletion.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not rent or sell your personal information. We may share limited information with trusted service providers
      (for example payment processors, hosting, analytics, and email providers) only as needed to operate the service.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>
      You may decline to provide certain information, but some features may not function. You can request access, correction,
      or deletion of account data by contacting support.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention and Security</h2>
    <p>
      We retain information while your account is active and as required for legal, operational, and security purposes.
      We use commercially reasonable safeguards, but no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children</h2>
    <p>EchoFlux is not intended for children under 13.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy periodically. Material updates will be reflected by updating the effective date and, when appropriate,
      providing additional notice in-product or by email.
    </p>
