    <h2>1. Age Requirements and Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use EchoFlux. Users under 18 must have parental or guardian permission.</p>
    <p>
      Adult content workflows (including Premium Content Studio capabilities) are restricted to users 18+ in jurisdictions where
      such access is legal.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Service Overview (Planning Mode)</h2>
    <p>
      EchoFlux currently operates as an AI content studio and planning tool. The platform is designed to help with planning,
      drafting, organization, and strategy. Manual posting may still be required depending on feature and integration availability.
    </p>

    <h2>3. AI-Powered Services</h2>
    <p>
      AI outputs are suggestions only. You are responsible for reviewing and editing generated content and for ensuring your final
      content complies with all applicable platform policies and laws.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Plans, Billing, and Fair Use</h2>
    <p>
      Plan names, limits, and pricing are shown in app and at checkout. We may update plan limits, features, or pricing over time.
      Paid plans follow billing terms shown at checkout.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep service stable, EchoFlux applies rate limits, quotas, and abuse protections. Heavy requests may be queued during peak load.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Use</h2>
    <p>You may not use EchoFlux to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automate prohibited behavior or violate third-party platform terms.</li>
      <li>Access non-permitted data or attempt unauthorized system access.</li>
      <li>Create or distribute illegal, fraudulent, harmful, or infringing content.</li>
      <li>Engage in abuse, harassment, hate speech, or promotion of self-harm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>EchoFlux software and branding are owned by us. You retain ownership of content you create and upload.</p>

    <h2>7. Availability, Disclaimer, and Liability</h2>
    <p>
      Service is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability or specific business outcomes
      from generated content.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms, applicable law, or platform security policies.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these terms periodically. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of revised terms.
